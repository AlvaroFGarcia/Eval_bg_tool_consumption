# Concentration Overlay Improvements

I have successfully implemented the requested improvements to the concentration overlay feature in your Fuel Consumption Evaluation Tool. Here are the key enhancements:

## 1. Enabled Concentration Overlay in Comparison Mode

**Previous Issue**: The concentration overlay was disabled when viewing comparison data (percentage differences between CSV and vehicle logs).

**Solution**: Removed the restriction that disabled the overlay in comparison mode. Now the concentration overlay works in:
- Normal percentage view
- CSV vs Vehicle log comparison mode
- Difference view (both percentage and absolute)

## 2. Enhanced Overlay Rendering with Smooth Gradient

**Previous Issue**: The concentration overlay was restricted to individual table cells, creating a blocky appearance.

**Solution**: Implemented advanced interpolation algorithms for smooth gradient rendering:
- **Gradient Mode**: Creates smooth, interpolated concentration gradients across the entire table
- **Scatter Mode**: Displays individual data points as colored circles with adjustable size and density
- **Customizable Transparency**: Overlay transparency can be adjusted from 0% to 100%
- **Blur Effects**: Optional blur for even smoother appearance

## 3. Advanced Control Panel

**New Features Added**:
- **Mode Selection**: Toggle between Gradient and Scatter overlay modes
- **Transparency Control**: Real-time adjustment with visual feedback
- **Blur Toggle**: Enable/disable blur effects for smoother gradients
- **Scatter Controls**: Size and density adjustment for scatter mode
- **Intensity & Gamma**: Fine-tune overlay appearance with intensity multiplier and gamma correction
- **Metrics Display**: Optional concentration statistics overlay
- Independent color controls for the concentration overlay

## 4. Enhanced Visual Experience

The concentration overlay now provides:
- **Real-time Updates**: All changes apply immediately without requiring window refresh
- **Preserved Functionality**: All existing features continue to work unchanged
- **Better Performance**: Optimized rendering for smooth interaction
- **Visual Feedback**: Slider values are displayed in real-time

## 5. Configuration Persistence

All concentration overlay settings are automatically saved to `fuel_config.json`:
- Overlay enabled/disabled state
- Transparency level
- Blur enabled state
- Current mode (gradient/scatter)
- Scatter size and density
- Intensity and gamma values
- Color scheme preferences

## 6. Fixed Concentration Overlay for "Create Surface Table from Vehicle log"

**Previous Issue**: The concentration overlay and percentage values shown in the "Create Surface Table from Vehicle log" functionality displayed Z-values instead of actual data point concentration percentages, making the overlay and table percentages incorrect.

**Solution**: Modified the `show_surface_creation_results` function to properly calculate concentration percentages from the point count matrix:
- Calculate proper concentration percentages: `(count_matrix / total_data_points) * 100`
- Pass these concentration percentages to the surface table viewer instead of Z-values
- Now the concentration overlay correctly shows time concentration in each cell
- Table percentage values now correctly show the percentage of time spent in each operating point

This fix ensures that both the table display and concentration overlay show meaningful concentration data, just like the working "Vehicle points of operation against CSV" functionality.

## How to Use

1. Open any surface table viewer
2. Check **Enable Concentration Overlay** checkbox
3. Adjust **Transparency** slider to your preference
4. Choose between **Gradient** and **Scatter** modes
5. Fine-tune appearance with additional controls
6. Toggle **Show Metrics** for concentration statistics

The concentration overlay now provides a much more sophisticated and visually appealing way to visualize operating time concentration across your fuel consumption surface tables.
