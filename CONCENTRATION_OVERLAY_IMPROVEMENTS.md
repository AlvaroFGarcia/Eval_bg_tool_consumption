# Concentration Overlay Improvements

## Summary of Changes

I have successfully implemented the requested improvements to the concentration overlay feature in your Fuel Consumption Evaluation Tool. Here are the key enhancements:

## 1. Enabled Concentration Overlay in Comparison Mode

**Previous Issue**: The concentration overlay was disabled when viewing comparison data (percentage differences between CSV and vehicle logs).

**Solution**: Removed the restriction that disabled the overlay in comparison mode. Now the concentration overlay works in:
- Normal surface table view
- Comparison mode (showing differences)
- All other viewing modes

## 2. Glass-Like, Non-Cell-Restricted Overlay

**Previous Issue**: The concentration overlay was restricted to individual table cells, creating a blocky appearance.

**New Implementation**: 
- Created a custom `ConcentrationOverlay` widget that renders on top of the table
- Uses smooth interpolation between data points rather than cell-by-cell coloring
- Creates a fluid, glass-like effect that flows across the entire table surface
- The overlay is not restricted to cell boundaries - it creates smooth gradients

## 3. Advanced Interpolation and Blur Effects

**Key Features**:
- **Cubic Interpolation**: Uses scipy's `griddata` with cubic interpolation for smooth transitions
- **Adaptive Resolution**: Automatically adjusts the overlay resolution based on viewport size
- **Gaussian Blur**: Optional blur effect using `gaussian_filter` for softer gradients
- **Real-time Updates**: The overlay updates dynamically when scrolling, resizing, or changing data

## 4. Enhanced Color and Transparency Controls

**Improvements**:
- Independent color controls for the concentration overlay
- Adjustable transparency slider (0-100%)
- Toggle for blur effects
- Configurable min/max colors for the concentration gradient
- Settings are saved and restored between sessions

## 5. Performance Optimizations

**Technical Improvements**:
- Efficient painting using Qt's native graphics system
- Fallback to radial gradients if interpolation fails
- Optimized update triggers only when necessary
- Proper handling of scroll and resize events

## 6. Fixed Cell Rendering Issues

**Bug Fixes**:
- Resolved issues with cells disappearing during scroll/resize
- Improved table viewport update handling
- Better event management for overlay positioning
- Enhanced resize event handling

## Usage

The concentration overlay now:
1. **Works in all modes**: Normal view, comparison mode, and difference calculations
2. **Flows smoothly**: Creates gradient effects that span across multiple cells
3. **Updates dynamically**: Responds to all table interactions (scroll, resize, data changes)
4. **Highly configurable**: Full control over colors, transparency, and blur effects

## Controls

- **Enable/Disable**: Checkbox to toggle the entire overlay
- **Transparency**: Slider to adjust opacity (0-100%)
- **Blur Effect**: Toggle for gaussian blur smoothing
- **Colors**: Separate color pickers for minimum and maximum concentration values
- **All settings persist**: Automatically saved to `fuel_config.json`

The concentration overlay now provides a much more sophisticated and visually appealing way to visualize operating time concentration across your fuel consumption surface tables.
