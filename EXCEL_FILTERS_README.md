# 🔽 Excel-like Column Filters for Vehicle Log Channel Appender

## Overview

The Vehicle Log Channel Appender now features comprehensive Excel-like filtering capabilities for the **Configured Custom Channels** table. This implementation provides the same filtering experience you'd expect from Microsoft Excel, with powerful include/exclude options and custom text filtering.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Column Header Filter Icons** 🔽
- Each column header now displays a **dropdown arrow icon (🔽)**
- Click any column header to open its dedicated filter dialog
- Active filters show a **green checkmark (🔽✅)** in the header

### 2. **Dual Filter Modes**
- **✅ Include Mode**: Show only rows with selected values
- **❌ Exclude Mode**: Hide rows with selected values
- Easy toggle between modes in each filter dialog

### 3. **Smart Value Selection**
- **Checkboxes** for each unique value in the column
- **Value counts** displayed next to each option `(e.g., "Engine_RPM (3)")`
- **Select All** / **Clear All** buttons for quick selection
- Preserves current selection when reopening filters

### 4. **Advanced Text Filters** 🔍
- **Contains**: Find values containing specific text
- **Starts with**: Values beginning with text
- **Ends with**: Values ending with text
- **Equals**: Exact matches only
- **Not contains**: Exclude values containing text
- **Apply Text Filter** button for quick selection based on criteria

### 5. **Multi-Column Filtering**
- Apply filters to **multiple columns simultaneously**
- Filters work together (AND logic)
- Each column maintains its own filter state
- Visual indicators show which columns are filtered

### 6. **Integration with Existing Features**
- **Search box** continues to work across all displayed data
- **Legacy filters** still available for advanced users
- **Clear All Filters** button removes all column filters instantly
- Compatible with existing import/export functionality

## 📋 Available Columns for Filtering

| Column | Description | Example Values |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Name** | Channel names | `Turbo_Pressure`, `Fuel_Map`, `EGT_Calc` |
| **CSV File** | Surface table filenames | `turbo_map.csv`, `injection.csv` |
| **X Col** | CSV X-axis columns | `RPM`, `Speed`, `Load` |
| **Y Col** | CSV Y-axis columns | `Load`, `ETASP`, `Throttle` |
| **Z Col** | CSV value columns | `Pressure`, `Timing`, `Temperature` |
| **Veh X** | Vehicle X channels | `Engine_RPM`, `Vehicle_Speed` |
| **Veh Y** | Vehicle Y channels | `Engine_Load`, `Throttle_Position` |
| **Units** | Engineering units | `bar`, `°C`, `%`, `deg` |
| **Comment** | User descriptions | `Main map`, `Backup calculation` |

## 🚀 How to Use

### Basic Filtering
1. **Click** any column header with the 🔽 icon
2. **Select/deselect** values using checkboxes
3. Choose **Include** or **Exclude** mode
4. Click **Apply Filter**

### Text-Based Filtering
1. Open any column filter dialog
2. Choose filter type from dropdown: `contains`, `starts with`, etc.
3. Enter text in the search field
4. Click **Apply Text Filter** to auto-select matching values
5. Click **Apply Filter** to execute

### Quick Operations
- **Select All**: Check all values in current column
- **Clear All**: Uncheck all values in current column
- **Clear Filter**: Remove filter from current column
- **Clear All Filters**: Remove all column filters at once

### Advanced Scenarios

#### Filter by Channel Type
- Filter **Name** column with `contains "Turbo"` to show only turbo-related channels
- Use **Exclude** mode to hide specific channel types

#### Filter by Engineering Units
- Filter **Units** column to show only `bar` pressure channels
- Combine with **Name** filter for specific pressure measurements

#### Filter by Vehicle Channels
- Filter **Veh X** for `Engine_RPM` to see all RPM-based calculations
- Filter **Veh Y** for different load/throttle parameters

#### Multi-Column Filtering
```
Example: Find all turbo pressure calculations using RPM/Load
1. Name: Contains "Turbo" ✅ Include
2. X Col: Select "RPM" ✅ Include  
3. Y Col: Select "Load" ✅ Include
4. Units: Select "bar" ✅ Include
Result: Shows only turbo pressure channels using RPM/Load in bar units
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Filter State Management
- Each column maintains independent filter state
- Filters persist until manually cleared or application restart
- Compatible with save/load settings functionality

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient value counting and unique value extraction
- Minimal UI updates during filtering operations
- Responsive interface even with large channel lists

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of empty columns
- Protection against invalid filter states
- User-friendly error messages

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 🔽 | Column has filtering capability |
| 🔽✅ | Column is currently filtered |
| ✅ | Include mode (show selected) |
| ❌ | Exclude mode (hide selected) |
| 🔍 | Text filter options |
| 🧹 | Clear/reset operations |

## 🔄 Integration Notes

### Backwards Compatibility
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- Legacy "Setup Filters" dialog still available
- Existing search box enhanced but compatible

### Export/Import Compatibility
- Filtered views don't affect export operations
- Import operations refresh and clear active filters
- Settings save/load includes filter preferences

## 💡 Tips and Best Practices

### Efficient Filtering Workflow
1. Start with broader filters (units, channel types)
2. Narrow down with specific text filters
3. Use search box for final refinement
4. Clear individual filters rather than all at once

### Performance Tips
- Use text filters to quickly select many values
- Combine include/exclude modes strategically
- Clear unused filters to improve performance

### Data Management
- Use consistent naming conventions for better filtering
- Include meaningful comments for easier searching
- Standardize units across similar calculations

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:
- Custom filter expressions with AND/OR logic
- Saved filter presets
- Filter history and undo functionality
- Quick filter buttons for common scenarios
- Export filtered data subsets
